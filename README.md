# Estimator-L-Fixed
This Program is Estimator with Fixed L Matrix Estimator. We have State Space with 3 State but only have few data. The file 'DataUntukTugas1.mat' 
is a file include input, output, and State x1. So we use estimator to estimate x2 and x3.

The Data Imported to MATLAB using importdata function. The Continous State Space matrix took from Ogata Modern Control System Book then we change it
to Discrete State Space with 0.6 Time Sampling.
